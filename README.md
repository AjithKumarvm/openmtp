### Introduction

##### Advanced Android File Transfer Application for macOS.

Transferring files between macOS and Android Devices or any other MTP devices has always been a nightmare. There are a few MTP apps which are available online but most of them are either too expensive or too uncomfortable to use. The official "Android File Transfer" app for macOS from Google has a lot of bugs and limitations, some of which includes not being able to transfer files larger than 4GB, frequent disconnections, unable to rename the folders or files on the android devices. Most of the other apps available online are too expensive and all of them uses either WiFi or ADB protocol to transfer the files, which by the way is really painful to watch.

All the above-mentioned reasons have prompted me to create an application on my own which will be available FREE to all and FOREVER.

### Features

- Plug and Play. No hassles, easy and instant connection.
- Connected via USB cable, hence providing the highest data transfer rates possible.
- Transfer files which are larger than 4GB.
- Can select between Internal Memory and SD Card.
- Split pane views for both Local Computer and MTP device.
- Grid and List views are available (check Settings).
- Drag n Drop and the other advanced File Manager features are available.
- Transparent, OpenSource and we care for your privacy.
- It's FREE and shall ALWAYS remain FREE!!
